About a week ago, I found an interest in web animations, which led me to explore online. During my search, I discovered Framer. After learning the basics of Framer, I wanted to put my new skills to use. So, I built this landing page using Framer along with the Bento grid layout, which is currently a trending web design approach.

I use React . Tailwind . and TS

And this designed is heavily inpired by a brilliant Web designer called dls_design on IG. I do not owned any assets here. All come from @sirreal.ai
