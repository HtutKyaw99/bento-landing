About a week ago, I found an interest in web animations, which led me to explore online. During my search, I discovered Framer. After learning the basics of Framer, I wanted to put my new skills to use. So, I built this landing page using Framer along with the Bento grid layout, which is currently a trending web design approach.

I use React . Tailwind . Framer and TS ![typescript](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9822331c-decd-4843-ab7c-d3cfe430fd83)

And this designed is heavily inpired by a brilliant Web designer called dls_design on IG. I do not own any assets here. All assets are from @sirreal.ai

Demo Link --> https://bentolanding.vercel.app/ and make sure to visit this on PC. It is not responsive.
